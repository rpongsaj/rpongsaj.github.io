            <h3>Bring people together</h3>
            <p>As product manager, I bridge the design and development processes on my team, helping to refine design concepts and turn them into actionable development tasks. I also communicate regularly with audiences, stakeholders, and project managers to better understand their needs and to ensure that our work is timely and grounded in reality.</p>

            <h3>Build sites for humans</h3>
            <p>It's important to me that people connect with the sites that I help build&mdash;not just technically but emotionally. I've had the privilege of sharing my design &amp; development skills and general enthusiasm for the web with colleagues and regularly work with students and faculty on academic and professional portfolios.</p>

            <h3>Continually improve</h3>
            <p>At Georgetown, my overarching goal has been to improve the many websites we help maintain. I've helped define our web strategy and have been focused on making regular improvements that add up to a significantly better experience in the long run&mdash;and championing our vision both internally and to the rest of the university.</p>

            <h3>Shifting web platforms at Georgetown</h3>
            <p>In 2018, Georgetown made the decision to <a href="https://sites.georgetown.edu/">switch from Drupal to WordPress</a>&mdash;and to migrate 300+ sites to the new platform within two years. I led the initial planning and oversaw design and development of our new WordPress theme&mdash;built to take full advantage of the new Gutenberg editor. I also worked with three project managers to direct our communications effort to content editors at the university.</p>

            <h3>Digital pedagogy and working with faculty</h3>
            <p>I worked closely with faculty in my previous position at <a href="https://cndls.georgetown.edu/">CNDLS</a>, helping them design and implement technology-enhanced learning experiments ranging from <a href="https://itel.georgetown.edu/projects/elmendorf/">creating digital microscopy exhibits</a> to <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/06/09/student-at-center-of-wikipedias-article-on-national-democratic-party-of-egypt/">integrating Wikipedia editing</a> into their courses. I also managed  large datasets from Georgetown's massive open online courses (MOOCs), performing analyses and creating reports and visualizations.</p>

            <h3>Mentorship, teaching, and presentations</h3>
            <p>I've presented sessions on information architecture, writing for the web, user-centered design, and learning analytics to various audiences over the years. I also supervised the work of several graduate students at CNDLS and have advised 150+ Georgetown graduate and undergraduate students on their professionally-focused web portfolios.
